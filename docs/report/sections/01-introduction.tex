\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\subsection{Project Context}

This report documents a comprehensive dependability analysis of a Spring Boot E-Commerce application, undertaken as part of the Software Dependability course at the Università degli Studi di Salerno (Academic Year 2024/2025). The analysis evaluates software quality across nine distinct criteria using industry-standard tools and methodologies.

The project represents a practical application of software dependability principles to a real-world backend application, demonstrating how modern development practices, automated testing, and continuous integration can ensure high-quality, maintainable software systems.

\subsection{Analyzed Application}

The target application is a Spring Boot-based REST API for an e-commerce platform, providing comprehensive checkout and order management functionality. The application exemplifies modern Java development practices:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Architecture}: RESTful web service architecture with Spring Boot 3.1.3
    \item \textbf{Data Layer}: JPA/Hibernate with Spring Data repositories
    \item \textbf{Business Logic}: Service layer implementing checkout workflows
    \item \textbf{API Layer}: REST controllers with JSON serialization
    \item \textbf{Database}: MySQL (production) / H2 (testing)
    \item \textbf{Build System}: Maven with extensive plugin ecosystem
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Application Features}

The e-commerce application provides the following core functionality:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Checkout Service}: Complete purchase workflow with order tracking number generation
    \item \textbf{Customer Management}: Customer registration and profile management
    \item \textbf{Order Processing}: Order creation with multiple order items
    \item \textbf{Product Catalog}: Product and category management
    \item \textbf{Address Handling}: Billing and shipping address management with state/country support
    \item \textbf{Data Persistence}: Transactional operations with JPA entities
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Analysis Objectives}

The primary objectives of this dependability analysis are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Quality Assessment}: Evaluate current software quality across multiple dimensions
    \item \textbf{Test Effectiveness}: Measure test suite quality using mutation testing (100\% target)
    \item \textbf{Security Posture}: Identify and address security vulnerabilities
    \item \textbf{Performance Baseline}: Establish performance benchmarks for core operations
    \item \textbf{Automation}: Implement comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with automated quality checks
    \item \textbf{Containerization}: Create production-ready Docker deployment
    \item \textbf{Documentation}: Provide detailed analysis and improvement documentation
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Nine Evaluation Criteria}

The analysis is structured around nine specific evaluation criteria:

\caption{Overview of Nine Evaluation Criteria}
\label{tab:criteria-overview}
\begin{tabular}{clp{6cm}}
\toprule
\textbf{\#} & \textbf{Criterion} & \textbf{Focus} \\
\midrule
1 & CI/CD Pipeline & Automated build, test, and deployment \\
2 & Static Analysis & Code quality via SonarCloud \\
3 & Docker Image & Containerized application build \\
4 & Docker Container & Runnable container deployment \\
5 & Test Coverage & JaCoCo code coverage measurement \\
6 & Mutation Testing & PITest test effectiveness evaluation \\
7 & Performance Testing & JMH benchmarking \\
8 & Test Generation & Randoop automated test creation \\
9 & Security Analysis & Vulnerability detection and mitigation \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Key Achievements}

This analysis achieved exceptional results across all evaluation criteria:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{100\% Mutation Score}: Complete mutation coverage on business logic (16/16 mutants killed)
    \item \textbf{91.9\% Code Coverage}: Comprehensive test coverage exceeding 80\% target
    \item \textbf{Zero Vulnerabilities}: No security issues detected (SonarCloud A rating)
    \item \textbf{1,626 Total Tests}: 161 manual + 1,465 generated tests
    \item \textbf{Triple-A Rating}: SonarCloud ratings: Security A, Reliability A, Maintainability A
    \item \textbf{Production-Ready Container}: Multi-stage Docker build with health checks
    \item \textbf{Fully Automated CI/CD}: GitHub Actions workflows for all quality checks
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Technical Innovations}

This project introduces several technical innovations in mutation testing and test quality evaluation:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Strategic Lombok Exclusion}: Configured PITest to exclude Lombok-generated methods (equals, hashCode, toString, canEqual) to focus mutation testing on business logic rather than framework-generated boilerplate code.
    
    \item \textbf{Edge Case Testing Strategy}: Developed comprehensive edge case tests covering boundary values, null handling, empty collections, and special characters to improve mutation score from 40\% to 100\%.
    
    \item \textbf{CI/CD Environment Management}: Solved integration test failures in CI environments by properly managing environment variable precedence for datasource configuration.
    
    \item \textbf{Business Logic Focus}: Demonstrated that focusing quality metrics on actual business code provides more meaningful insights than including auto-generated framework code.
\end{enumerate}
